Avi Tevet's EnergyQuest implementation
========================================

This is an implementation of the EnergyQuest game (https://gist.github.com/jesseadams/8dd29d63f2d65287a675)

How to play this implementation
--------------------------------
Run the energy_quest.rb file using ruby 1.9.3.

    ruby1.9.3 -I. energy_quest.rb

You are the 'X' on the board.  You are surrounded by walls ('W's).  You can move inside the walls, but not on or outside of them.

Type 'u' for Up, 'd' for Down, 'l' for Left, 'r' for Right, or 'q' for quit.  

You can win the game if you get to 100 energy.  You will die if you reach 0 energy.  Your energy is printed just above the board.
